The thermostat project utilizes a TI SimpleLink Wi-Fi CC3220S wireless microcontroller for its connectivity and functionality. This microcontroller, based on the powerful ARM Cortex-M4 core, offers built-in Wi-Fi capabilities, eliminating the need for external Wi-Fi modules.
The CC3220S microcontroller integrates an on-chip Wi-Fi network processor, enabling seamless connectivity to the cloud. Its built-in networking stack and software development kit (SDK) simplify the implementation of Wi-Fi communication.

In addition to Wi-Fi capabilities, the microcontroller provides various peripherals necessary for the thermostat project. It includes I2C, GPIO, UART, and timers, allowing for temperature sensing, LED output control, button detection, and data transmission.

For temperature sensing, the I2C peripheral is used to interface with a temperature sensor, providing accurate temperature readings. GPIO pins are configured to control the LED output, indicating the room temperature, and detect button presses for adjusting the set temperature.

The UART peripheral is employed to simulate data transmission to the cloud server. It is configured with the appropriate baud rate and serial configuration to establish communication with the server. Through the UART interface, the microcontroller efficiently transmits data to the cloud, enabling remote monitoring and control.

The microcontroller's Flash memory offers ample storage capacity for the code, accommodating the implementation of complex functionality. The available RAM resources support efficient data processing and execution of the code.
